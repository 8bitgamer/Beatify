Installation
============

1.  Create a folder called Spotify in your home directory and copy the Beatify folder to directory. 

* ~/Spotify/beatify (for Mac OS X and Linux )
* My Documents/Spotify/beatify (for Microsoft)

2.  Open Spotify application and type "spotify:app:beatify" to search bar. It will find your application and ask you to add to favorites. 

Usage
=====

Open the application from the app menu on the left and drag a playlist to shown area in Beatify app.


Troubleshooting
===============

Beatify uses Echonest servers to collect bpm information. It allows 120 requests per second. Because of limitations, you might not be able to see bpm information at first. If you can't see bpm information, try dragging the playlist again. Once Beatify pulls bpm information, it stores in the cache and it doesn't make request for a song for second time.
